     <h2>Lack of Funding</h2>
     <p>
     Funding is the act of providing financial resources, usually in the form of money,
         or other values such as effort or time, to finance a need, program, and project,
         usually by an organisation or government.
          Sources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants, savings,
         subsidies, and taxes. Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants that have
         no direct requirement for return of investment are described as "soft funding" or "
         crowdfunding". Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity ownership in a company for capital
         The Lack Funding missed in the Education and the School Sector in  each New York's Borough : Brooklyn,
         Bronx ,Queen, Manhattan,Staten Island.
         It focuses on causal links among four elements: social exclusion, poverty, exits from poverty and
         overall processes that generate inequality among social categories.
         Social exclusion lies at the heart of inequality-generating processes.
         Exclusion itself promotes poverty, and exits from poverty therefore depend on eliminating or bypassing
         the usual effects of social exclusion.
         Political programmes to address political interests are required.
         This LineChart and BarChart describes the Situation .

            <h2>The Poverty and Homeless</h2>
            <p>The political, economic and social impacts on organised exclusion from such benefits are significant.
                Although overall investments in economic growth may well produce collective exits from poverty,
                the social, economic and political organisation of exclusion makes it likely that very poor people will benefit least and last from broad interventions.
                Further findings are that:
                In the short- and medium-term, broad investment programmes
                that succeed will commonly increase inequality and therefore the relative deprivation of the very poor.
                In particular,
                membership in stigmatised categories and lack of facilitating interpersonal connections regularly combine to exclude very poor people from mobility opportunities.
                Existing political arrangements usually reinforce these forms of exclusion.
                The BarChart LineChart and Piechart describes the situation in the last years.

              <h2> The Taxes and benefit</h2>
          <P>
             The federal government defines individuals and families as being in poverty if their household income
              falls below a certain level. The level varies based on household size and, to a lesser extent,
              location.
              Although many government programs base their eligibility requirements on federal poverty guidelines,
              taxes have a minor link to them.
              The last year increase the taxes without benefit and highest poverty in the last Year.
